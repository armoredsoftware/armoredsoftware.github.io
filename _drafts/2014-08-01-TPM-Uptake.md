title: TPM Uptake
---
Here's a link to a nice article on
[TPM Uptake](http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240225813/Analyis-Enterprise-finally-embraces-TPM-based-security)
from Computer Weekly. Most enterprise computers have a hardware TPM on
board, but they are rarely used. Microsoft's BitLocker is one
application that does and I've heard Chromebooks use a TPM to protect
information in the cloud.  However, broad uptake has been slow.  This
article suggests that might be changing.  Furthermore, TCG is
introducing the TPM 2.0 shortly that will be more flexible than the
current 1.2.  Only time will tell.
