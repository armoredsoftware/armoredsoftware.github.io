ArmoredSoftware web pages are hosted on GitHub using the standard
GitHub Pages approach.

Every repo can have it's own associated website and wiki.  Websites
are our window to the world.  They are for information, documentation,
downloads, and other things we would like others to see.  Websites
associated with a repo
are special branches named `gh-pages`.  Thus, if you want to work
on a website associated with a repo, you should clone the repo and
checkout the `gh-pages`.  This is really cool because when you
clone a repository, you also clone its web pages.  

Wikis are found on GitHub web pages associated with a repo.  You'll
see a wiki link on the right of the page.  You can edit the wiki
online or you can clone it.  If your repo is named `fubar.git`, then
its associated wiki is named `fubar.wiki.git`.

All of our web pages and wikis are written in Markdown.  If you don't
know Markdown, it is trivial to learn.
