### Repos

* `armoredsoftware.github.io` - Website repo that contains the project
  website.
* `admin` - Administrative cruft.  This is the only repo that is not
  publicly available.  Students need not have access to this repo.  
* `doc` - System documentation.  Design documents, presentations,
  capability descriptions, and formal documentation.  Current
  documentation should always be on the `main` branch.
* `code` - All code for the system.  Source code, Makefiles,
  configuration files, scripts, and anything else required for
  building the base ArmoredSoftware system.  Current system should always be
  on the `main` branch.

* `doc.wiki` - Public ArmoredSoftware wiki.  Meeting notes are here as
  well as general notes on development and informal documentation.
  Add pages here for documenting design decisions and discussions.
